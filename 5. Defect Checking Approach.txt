I order to check for defects, I would write test cases to check for correct functionality in standard cases. The test would act as a user and alter the state of the tv (e.g. increase the channel) and then check that the variable after the change is as expected (e.g. the channel is one higher than it was at the start). I would also use these test cases to check that the correct output was printed when the upper and lower bounds of the volume/brightness/channel were reached, and that these variables would not be altered beyond their limits (e.g. channel would not become 0 if user asked to decrease it when it was already 1).

I would then write tests to check responses in nonstandard cases, such as the user entering a letter other than a or b. These would check that the state of the tv has not changed, and that the output is as expected (continuing to ask for a command).
